Taken from this website https://www.wix.engineering/post/why-i-stop-prompting-and-start-logging-the-design-log-methodology  
Check the website on how to use this new methodology.  
Provides an interesting alternative to mindless prompt engineering or vibe coding.  
Basic idea is to document the design of the system in a structured way, and then use that document to generate the code, which is not novel.  
The novel part is keeping track of past decisions and design implementations, so that we do not have to prompt the ai agent to remember past decisions.
