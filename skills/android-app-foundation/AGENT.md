# Android App Foundation (Agent-Agnostic Entry)

Use this folder as a reusable build-from-start skill for any coding agent.

## Primary instruction source

- Read `SKILL.md` first.
- Load only the reference that matches the project stack:
  - `references/react-native.md`
  - `references/kotlin-compose.md`

## Invocation hint

Use this skill at the beginning of a new Android app or feature set to define clean architecture and avoid duplicated screen logic later.
